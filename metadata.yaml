description: The letters included in this volume were written by Theodore Roosevelt
  to his children during a period of more than twenty years. Deep and abiding love
  of children, of family and home--this was the dominating passion of his life. Whenever
  he was separated from them--in the Spanish War, or on a hunting trip, or because
  they were at school--he sent his children these messages of constant thought and
  love, for they were never for a moment out of his mind and heart.
